# Vigenere-Cipher-Encoder-Decoder
A Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting and decrypting text based on a specific keyword. My program allows users to both encrypt and decrypt words using this method. It takes three inputs. 1: a 1 or a 2 indicating whether you would like to encrypt or decrypt, 2: a specified word to encrypt or decrypt, 3: a keyword used as the key to encode or decode words. The output is a string of seemingly random characters that don't make any sense unless you have the decryption key.

To run this program, download the CiperProgram.cs file and put it in your favorite C# IDE. Everything is contained in that file and runs through the provided main method inside the class.

This cipher program was made for educational purposes and cannot guarantee strong security in the encrypted words. The output of this program will always be uppercase ASCII characters.

This was made by a student who cannot guarantee the correctness of every output. If the intended use of this program is to encrypt sensitive information, please double check the output with other sources.
